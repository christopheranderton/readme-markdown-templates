## Google Fonts

A general rule is to use a maximum of 3 fonts per project. Using Google Fonts, that rule is even more important as they adds additional resources for the page to load. More resources loaded = slower site even if the fonts are served from Googleâ€™s CDN and are cached.

### Notes

[[Back To Top]](#jump-to-section)

 **Note 1** Recommended is to load 2 fonts from an external provider (like Google Fonts or Adobe Typekit) if neccessary. 

 Monospaced fonts are unnecessary to load from a external provider as the most operating systems already have good monospaced fonts installed. Cursive fonts (or script fonts) are rarely used, and when they are, they tend to be used for decoration.)
